            PREAMBLE
            <br>
            The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
            <br>
            development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
            <br>
            efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
            <br>
            open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
            <br>
            with others.
            <br>
            <br>
            The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
            <br>
            redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
            <br>
            fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
            <br>
            redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
            <br>
            names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
            <br>
            however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
            <br>
            requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
            <br>
            to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
            <br>
            <br>

            PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

            Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
            <br>
            a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,

            redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font

            Software, subject to the following conditions:
            <br>
            <br>
            1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
            <br>
            in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
            <br>
            redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy

            in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
            <br>
            binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

            <br>
            3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font

            Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
            <br>
            Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
            <br>
            presented to the users.
            <br>
            <br>
            4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
            <br>
            Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
            <br>
            Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

            <br>
            TERMINATION
            <br>
