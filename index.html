            <p>
                Lemoncake is an OS written in Rust, and was created by <a href="https://github.com/SniverDaBest">SniverDaBest</a>.
                <br>
                It was originally called <a href="https://github.com/SniverDaBest/lemonade">Lemonade</a>, but because of changes in the Rust programming language, I had to restart the entire project.
                <br>
                The OS uses a monolitic kernel design. It tries to have things like drivers, and filesystem management done in the kernel.
                <br>
                It's licensed under the BSD 2-clause license, to let anyone possibly fork, and contribute. Maybe even make their own OS based off of this one!

            <p>
                If you're having trouble running Lemoncake in a VM (or don't know how to) then follow these steps.

                    <dd><span id="peach"></span> Run <code lang="shell">git clone https://github.com/SniverDaBest/lemoncake && cd lemoncake</code> in your commandline.</dd>

                    <dt><span id="mauve"></span> Compile and/or Run the OS with Qemu</dt>
                    <dd><span id="peach"></span> To compile the OS and run it with Qemu, you can type in <code lang="shell">cargo run</code>. However, if you just want to compile the disk image, you can run <code lang="shell">cargo build</code>.</dd>

            <h3><a id="linkbios" class="link" onclick="copied('linkbios')"></a> Compiling for BIOS</h3>
            <p>
                <b id="yellow">WARNING</b>: Using the BIOS version of Lemoncake may not work correctly. UEFI support is more important to focus on, since BIOS is legacy, and very few modern computers don't have UEFI.
                <br>
                <br>
                Follow instructions 1-3 of the <a href="#linkrunning">Running the VM</a> section. Once you complete them, open the src/main.rs file with a text editor. <i id="o2">(<span id="teal">TIP</span>: This is not to be confused with kernel/src/main.rs)</i>
                <br>
                Then, modify line 7 from <code lang="rust"><span id="mauve">let</span> uefi <span id="teal">=</span> <span id="peach">true</span><span id="o2">;</span></code> to <code lang="rust"><span id="mauve">let</span> uefi <span id="teal">=</span> <span id="peach">false</span><span id="o2">;</span></code>
                <br>
                Now, complete step four of the <a href="#linkrunning">Running the VM</a> section. You have now ran Lemoncake as BIOS.
